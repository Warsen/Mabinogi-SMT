## Getting Started

In order to effectively use this tool you will need to have already figured out what position you are at in your conversations with Kaour, Elsie, Dai, and Eirlys. Once you start Mabinogi Squire Multi Tracker, you must type in your Mabinogi character's name (or other identifiable name) into the menu and press the 'Add Character' button to have your character's progress saved. For each squire, you may then click on the 'View Chart' button to see a chart of their conversations and an input text box that will allow you to set your progress number for that squire.

## Help

If you don't know your progress numbers, you can use a similar web-based tool to help you to figure out what your progress numbers are at:

At the top-right of that site, you can click the question mark button for a full explanation of how to find out your progress numbers. If this is your first time using a Mabinogi squire conversation tracker, you may want to stick to using that website which is an easier to use tool for beginners. If you ever want to use the features of Mabinogi Squire Multi Tracker, you can come back and use your progress numbers after you know them.
