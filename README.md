## Getting Started

**In order to effectively use this tool, you will need to have already
figured out what position you are at in your conversations with Kaour,
Elsie, Dai, and Eirlys. A player who has not attempted conversations with
them will start at &#35;1.**

Enter your character's name into the drop-down list at the upper left corner
of the main window, then click the *Add Character* button. You will do this
every time you want to add a new character for tracking. To delete a
character, make sure they are selected, then press the *X* button which is
right of the *Add Character* button.

If you have never attempted conversations with Kaour, Elsie, Dai, or Eirlys
on your character, you will be able to use this tool immediately.

If you have already attempted conversations with Kaour, Elsie, Dai,
or Eirlys on your character, you will need to know your progression numbers
or figure them out using a notepad and writing down your successful
conversations with a trial-and-error method. An issue with using the
trial-and-error method is that you might be thrown off by *special
conversations*. Strike out any successful special conversations and leave
an asterisk to indicate it is a wildcard. After you have done 3 to 5
successful conversations, you can view the chart for that squire and look
through the list to see where your sequence of successful conversations
accurately fits the list. Unless you have been using another tracking tool,
it is unlikely that you have gotten far from &#35;1. Your position is
immediately after the matching sequence. You can enter your number into a
text box in the *View Chart* button window for that squire.

## Using The Tool

Using the tool is simple, the keywords you will need to speak with each
squire are listed to the right of their name and have the same color. Click
on *Confirm Thrice* next to a squire's keywords to confirm that you've had
three successful conversations with that squire. You will know a
conversation is successful because the squire's likability will increase
and a message will appear across the center of the game telling you it
increased or that can not increase further. If you make a mistake and
likability stays or decreases with a negative message appearing across
the center of the game, you should click on the *Confirm Three* checkmark,
which will turn the *Confirm Thrice* buttons into *Confirm Once*, then
press *Confirm Once* for every successful conversation you did have.

Conversation keywords are blacked out once they're done. This helps you
know who you've talked to on this in-game day. Once the new day has turned
over (6 AM in-game time), you can press the *Reset Day* button to get new
keywords. When you close Mabinogi Squire Multi Tracker, it will save your
information to a plain text file, *configuration.txt*.

*Special conversations* are conversation keywords that must be used when the
squire is at or just above the listed likability level and percentage before
you can proceed beyond that likability. Special conversation keywords will
take the place of a regular conversation keyword. If you progress through
a special conversation while doing your three conversations, you will still
need to confirm the number of successful conversations you had with that
squire then additionally press *Confirm* under the special conversation
label.

**_Special conversations_ at likability level 3 and above are only required
if the squire is a member of your team. Once they are on your team, you will
need to do any special conversations that you previously passed over.**

If you make any mistakes and feel that your progression number is incorrect,
use the *View Chart* button for that squire to view the squire's chart and
your current position on that chart. Talk to Shuan, select *View Shuan's
Information*, select *Squire Interests Today*, pick your squire and find out
what the correct conversation with them is supposed to be. On the chart
window, make a guess on what your correct number is supposed to be, based on
the type of mistake you made. It should not be further than 3 positions more
or less than its current position.

If you accidentally forgot to confirm your conversations, the true position
might be ahead of your current position. If you accidentally confirmed more
conversations than the number that were successful, the true position might
be behind your current position. If you accidentally forgot to do a special
conversation, check your squire's likability. If it is now below the special
conversation's likability requirement, you will have to do Shuan's
recommended conversation, then the special conversation, then figure out
where the true position should be.
